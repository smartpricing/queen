Why "Queen"? Because years ago, when I first read the word "queue" in my mind, I read it as "queen".

## Introduction

QueenMQ is a queue system written in C++ and backed by PostgreSQL, born from the need to manage many FIFO partitions for Smartchat with solid guarantees around delivery and failure handling. During the initial development, I realized that with a few simple additions to the original design, I could build a very powerful and flexible queue system. This project is almost entirely written by AI, with my supervision‚Äîonly the test files (or a good part of them) are manually written.

Here are the main features:
- Unlimited FIFO partitions within queues
- Queue semantics like RabbitMQ
- Consumer groups over queues like Kafka
- QoS levels: Exactly-once delivery (with transactionId), at-least-once delivery, and at-most-once delivery
- Subscription modes for replay (new messages only or from a specific timestamp) and message history control
- Transactions between operations (push and ack mainly) for atomicity
- Dead letter queue for failure handling
- Lease renewal for long-running tasks
- Message tracing for debugging workflows
- Encryption of messages at DB level

The system consists of a PostgreSQL database, a replicated server that can be scaled horizontally (though it won't be the bottleneck), and a client library for interacting with the server. All client-server communication happens over HTTP, and the client library is written in JavaScript (support for other languages is planned). There's also a modern Vue 3 web app for monitoring and managing the system.

With proper batching, the system can handle +100k **messages** per second (not req/s) on modest hardware.

## One single example

> üìñ **[Complete Guide: client-js/client-v2/README.md](client-js/client-v2/README.md)** - Full tutorial with all features!

```javascript
import { Queen } from 'queen-mq'

// Connect to Queen
const queen = new Queen('http://localhost:6632')

// Create a queue
await queen
.queue('critical-task')
.config({
  leaseTime: 10, // 10 seconds to process the messages (seconds)
})
.create()

// Push messages
await queen
.queue('critical-task')
.partition('tenant-123')
.push([
  { 
    transactionId: 'my-id', // This is autogenerated, but you can set your own. Unique per queue partition.
    data: { id: 123, description: 'Critical task' }  // The message payload
  },
])
.onSuccess(async (messages) => { // Not mandatory
  console.log('Messages pushed successfully:', messages)
})
.onDuplicate(async (messages) => { // Not mandatory, triggered when a message with the same transactionId is pushed
  console.warn('Duplicate transaction IDs detected')
})
.onError(async (messages, error) => {  // Without callbacks, push throws an error if some messages are not pushed
  console.error('Error pushing messages:', error)
})

// Consume messages (auto-ack on success, auto-nack on error)
await queen
.queue('critical-task')
// The consumer group name, without this, the messages are processed in queue mode
.group('processor-consumer-group') 
// 10 parallel workers
.concurrency(10)
// I want to manually ack/nack messages 
.autoAck(false) 
// 10 messages per batch, prefetch them
.batch(10) 
// Auto-renew the lease for the messages every 2 seconds
.renewLease(true, 2000) 
// Process each message individually
.each() 
// Do your work here
.consume(async (message) => {
  console.log('Processing:', message.data) 
})
// Ack the messages if you processed them successfully
.onSuccess(async (messages) => {
  await queen.ack(messages)
})
// Nack the messages if you failed to process them
.onError(async (messages, error) => {
  console.error('Error processing messages:', error)
  await queen.ack(messages, false)
})
```

## Webapp

A modern Vue 3 web interface for managing and monitoring Queen MQ.

![Queen MQ Dashboard](./assets/dashboard.png)


**Features:**
- üìä Real-time dashboard with system metrics
- üìà Message throughput visualization
- üîç Queue management and monitoring
- üë• Consumer group tracking
- üí¨ Message browser with trace timeline
- üîé **Trace explorer for debugging distributed workflows**
- üìâ Analytics and insights
- üåì Dark/light theme support

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:4000` or at `http://localhost:6632` directly from the server.

See [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md) for more details.



## Architecture

Queen uses a high-performance **acceptor/worker pattern** with uWebSockets, combining non-blocking I/O for HTTP/WebSocket with a dedicated thread pool for database operations.

**View the interactive architecture diagram:** [architecture.svg](./assets/architecture.svg)

**Key Components:**
- **UWS Acceptor**: Single thread listening on port 6632, round-robin distributes to workers
- **UWS Workers**: N event loop threads (default: 10) handling HTTP routes and WebSocket
- **Response Timers**: Per-worker timers (25ms tick) drain response queue back to clients
- **DB ThreadPool**: Separate pool for blocking PostgreSQL operations
- **Poll Workers**: 2 reserved threads for long-polling with adaptive backoff (100ms‚Üí2000ms)
- **Poll Intention Registry**: Thread-safe store for long-poll requests
- **Database Pool**: 150 shared PostgreSQL connections (libpq) with mutex/condition variable
- **Response Queue**: Thread-safe queue decoupling DB results from event loop responses

**Request Flow:**
1. Client ‚Üí Acceptor ‚Üí Worker (event loop)
2. Worker registers response, submits job to DB ThreadPool
3. DB thread executes query, pushes result to Response Queue
4. Worker's response timer drains queue, sends HTTP response

**Long-Polling Flow:**
1. No immediate messages? Register intention in Registry
2. Poll Workers wake every 50ms, group intentions by queue/partition/consumer
3. Rate-limited DB queries (100ms initial, exponential backoff to 2s)
4. Messages distributed to waiting clients via Response Queue
5. Timeouts detected by Poll Workers, send 204 No Content

This architecture provides high concurrency, efficient connection pooling, and minimal latency for both immediate and long-polling requests.

### PostgreSQL Failover

Queen automatically buffers messages to disk when PostgreSQL is unavailable - **zero message loss**:

- Normal pushes go directly to PostgreSQL (FIFO preserved)
- If PostgreSQL is down, messages buffered to file (macOS: `/tmp/queen`, Linux: `/var/lib/queen/buffers`)
- Automatic replay when PostgreSQL recovers
- Survives server crashes and restarts
- Directory auto-created on first run

**No configuration needed** - failover is automatic!

**Custom directory:**
```bash
FILE_BUFFER_DIR=/custom/path ./bin/queen-server
```



## Install server and configure it

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Roadmap

### Server Startup Timing (Critical)
**Issue:** Worker initialization timeout (30s ‚Üí 3600s) now matches file buffer recovery timeout. This is a temporary fix.

**Better Solution Needed:**
- Make recovery non-blocking while preserving FIFO ordering guarantees
- Implement progressive readiness with memory-buffered queue during recovery
- Add configurable recovery timeout with graceful degradation
- See: `server/src/services/file_buffer.cpp:212` (MAX_STARTUP_RECOVERY_SECONDS)
- See: `server/src/acceptor_server.cpp:1876` (worker initialization timeout)


### Other TODO Items
- retention jobs
- auth
- streaming engine
