> **Version 0.14.1** — Updated frontend with new metrics and embedded dev guide; Google auth on the proxy; Prometheus metrics route; significantly optimized lease renewal; delete partition and delete messages support. Built on top of the 0.14.0 engine — see table below for full history.

Queen MQ is a partitioned message queue backed by PostgreSQL, built with uWebSockets, libuv, and libpq async API. It features unlimited FIFO partitions that process independently, consumer groups with replay, transactional delivery, tracing, and ACID-guaranteed durability — all in a single stateless binary alongside the Postgres you already run. Version 0.14.0 sustains **104k msg/s** push and **165k msg/s** fan-out on a 32-core host, with a broker RSS under 52 MB.

See [examples/base.js](examples/base.js) for a complete (push, consume, transactionally ack and push to another queue) example. An experimental PostgreSQL extension version is also available at [pg_qpubsub](pg_qpubsub/README.md).

## Why Queen?

Born at [Smartness](https://www.linkedin.com/company/smartness-com/) to power **Smartchat**, Queen solves a unique problem: **unlimited FIFO partitions** where slow processing in one partition doesn't block others.

Perfect for:

- **One ordered lane per entity, no preallocation** — 10,000 partitions cost index rows, not 10,000 commit-log files. A partition is created on first push; a slow consumer on one partition never stalls another.
- **Transactional integration with PostgreSQL** — `BEGIN; INSERT order; queen.push(...); COMMIT;` in a single PG transaction. The transactional-outbox pattern is built in.
- **Fan-out with fairness** — consumer groups each get a full copy of every message; the adaptive engine keeps delivery fair across groups at sub-linear CPU cost.
- **52 MB broker at 104k msg/s** — no JVM, no Erlang, no cluster to operate. One Docker container plus your existing Postgres.
- **Replay and DLQ** — rewind any consumer group to any timestamp; failed messages surface in a per-queue dead-letter queue automatically.
- **Zero message loss, verified** — 1.6 billion events across the benchmark suite, zero lost, zero duplicates.

## Quick Start

Create a Docker network and start PostgreSQL and Queen Server:

```bash
# Create a Docker network for Queen components
docker network create queen

# Start PostgreSQL
docker run --name qpg --network queen -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5433:5432 -d postgres

# Wait for PostgreSQL to start
sleep 2

# Start Queen Server
docker run -p 6632:6632 --network queen -e PG_HOST=qpg -e PG_PORT=5432 -e PG_PASSWORD=postgres -e NUM_WORKERS=2 -e DB_POOL_SIZE=5 -e SIDECAR_POOL_SIZE=30 smartnessai/queen-mq:0.14.1
```

Then in another terminal, use cURL (or the client libraries) to push and consume messages

**Push message:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6632/api/v1/push \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"items": [{"queue": "demo", "payload": {"hello": "world"}}]}'
```

that returns something like:

```json
[{"message_id": "...", "status": "queued", ...}]
```

**Consume message:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:6632/api/v1/pop/queue/demo?autoAck=true"
```

that returns something like:

```json
{"messages": [{"data": {"hello": "world"}, ...}], "success": true}
```

Then go to the dashboard ([http://localhost:6632](http://localhost:6632)) to see the messages and the status of the queue.

Benchmarked on real hardware: **104k msg/s** push (batch=100), **165k msg/s** fan-out across 10 consumer groups, pop throughput **+80–90%** vs 0.12 under partition contention, 52 MB server RSS at peak, zero message loss across 1.6B events.

## Latest bug fixing and improvements

- Server/App 0.14.1: **Updated frontend.** New metrics views and an embedded developer guide surfaced directly in the dashboard.
- Proxy 0.14.1: **Google OAuth support.** The proxy now supports Google as an OAuth provider for end-to-end authentication without a custom identity server.
- Server 0.14.1: **Prometheus metrics route.** A `/metrics` endpoint exposes standard Prometheus-compatible metrics for scraping.
- Server 0.14.1: **Significantly optimized lease renewal.** Reduced lock contention and database round-trips on the hot lease-renewal path, lowering tail latency under high consumer concurrency.
- Server/App 0.14.1: **Delete partition and delete messages.** New API and dashboard actions to delete individual partitions or bulk-delete messages from a queue.
- Server and clients 0.14.0: **New dynamic libqueen loop.** Full rewrite of the core scheduling engine — adaptive concurrency controller (TCP-Vegas-style) now drives push, pop, ack, and stats independently. Active DB connections stay at ~2.5 even with a pool of 50 under 104k msg/s peak load. Largely eliminates the PG deadlock mode that appeared under heavy fan-out at high partition counts on 0.12 (occasional deadlocks still observed at 10 001 partitions, all absorbed by file-buffer failover — see [benchmarks](https://queenmq.com/benchmarks.html)).
- Server 0.14.0: **Rewritten stored procedures.** `push_messages_v3`, `pop_messages_v3`, `ack_messages_v2`, and stats procedures redesigned around the new loop. PG memory usage 30–70% lower for equivalent workloads vs 0.12. Pop throughput +80–90% under partition contention.
- Clients 0.14.0: **`maxPartitions` on all clients.** JS, Python, Go, Laravel, and C++ clients expose `maxPartitions` on queue creation and configuration.
- Server 0.14.0: **New frontend.** Redesigned dashboard for the new stats model.
- Server 0.13.0: **New libqueen with adaptive engine.** Per-worker push/ack drain factored into three independently-tuned concerns — batching, concurrency, scheduling — glued by an event-driven orchestrator. Fixes two long-standing bottlenecks: per-commit overhead amortization on small-batch workloads, and the single-slot-per-drain cap on high-fanout workloads. Perf harness numbers: S1 ~6.2k → ~13k pg_ins/s, S3 ~4.7k → ~20k pg_ins/s, PG pinned instead of idle. Design notes in `cdocs/LIBQUEEN_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
- Server 0.13.0: **New push stored procedure.** `queen.push_messages_v2` rewritten around a temp-table + batched-insert pipeline that feeds cleanly into the adaptive engine. HTTP contract (queued/duplicate/failed) unchanged.
- Server 0.13.0: **New Vue 3 dashboard.** Reworked queues, analytics, DLQ management, and maintenance-mode views. Served by the same C++ acceptor at `/`.
- Server 0.13.0: Added server-stamped `producerSub` to close the impersonation vector from GitHub issue #23. When JWT auth is enabled the server stamps the validated `sub` claim on every pushed message; clients cannot set this field and it is exposed on pop responses and admin message APIs. Schema migration is additive and metadata-only (no table rewrite), safe on tables with millions of rows.
- Clients 0.13.0: All clients (JS, Python, Go, Laravel, C++) expose `producerSub` on popped messages; Go adds a typed `Message.ProducerSub` field.
- Server 0.12.19: Fix bug where seek or cg delete did not delete the watermark.
- Server 0.12.13: Added watermark tracking for efficient wildcard POP discovery — x20 faster pop on high partition count queues.
- Server 0.12.12: Added built-in database migration — stream pg_dump | pg_restore directly from the dashboard, no temp file, selective table groups, row count validation.
- Clients 0.12.2: Added custom `headers` option to JS, Python, and Go clients for API gateway authentication.
- Server 0.12.9: Fixed server crash (SIGSEGV) on lease renewal; added native EdDSA and JWKS JWT authentication (auto-discovery via `JWT_JWKS_URL`).
- Server 0.12.3: Added JWT authentication.
