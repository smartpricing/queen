# Performance Results Log

Consolidated analysis of all `test-perf/` campaigns up to the start of the Nagle-style hot-path work.

All raw data is archived outside the repo at `~/queen-perf-archives/` so it survives branch switches. Each archive is a `.tar.gz` of the full campaign directory (meta.json, per-run artifacts, aggregate.json, report.md).

To restore any campaign:

```bash
cd ~/Work/queen/test-perf/results
tar -xzf ~/queen-perf-archives/<archive>.tar.gz
# open the extracted <timestamp>/report.md

## 0. Harness evolution (what changed, and why)

The harness went through three iterations as we discovered validity issues. Each campaign ran with a specific version of the harness; results are only comparable within the same harness version unless noted.


| Harness version | Campaign that introduced it                    | Key change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **v1**          | `baseline_master_fce1833_2026-04-20.tar.gz`    | Initial scaffolding: 7 scenarios × 3 runs × 60 s measurement. Consumer used `/pop/partition/<p>?wait=false`. Autocannon metrics only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **v2**          | `baseline-v2_master_fce1833_2026-04-21.tar.gz` | Added PG ground truth (`pg_stat_database` + `pg_stat_user_tables` pre/post diff), streaming docker stats + server CPU, `--cpuset-cpus` pinning, host-oversubscription flag, cosmetic warning filter. Per-scenario `MAX_PARTITIONS = max(500, 2× prod_conns)` to avoid producer partition contention.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **v3**          | `baseline-v3_master_fce1833_3scen_120s.tar.gz` | Consumer switched to **wildcard long-poll** (`/pop/queue/<q>?wait=true&timeout=5000`) — the production consumer path. Measurement window doubled to **120 s** to tighten stddev. Oversubscription threshold relaxed to `heavy_threads ≥ host_cpus`. Scenario set pruned to 3 clean ones: S0, S1, S3. PG volume teardown made robust against Docker race. `run-all.sh` reads `scenarios.json` defaults (measure_seconds was silently hardcoded to 60). |


Harness v3 is what every subsequent campaign has used.

## 1. Campaign ledger (all archives, chronological)

### 1.1 `baseline_master_fce1833_2026-04-20.tar.gz`

- **Branch**: `master @ fce1833`
- **Date**: 2026-04-20 16:59 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v1
- **Scope**: 7 scenarios × 3 runs × 60 s
- **Purpose**: first proof-of-concept run of the harness.
- **Headline** (client-side `push_msgs/s`):
  - S1 pg2c4g/q2w: 9,396 ± 1,182 (best)
  - S7 pg4c8g/q8w + 16w/800c load: 3,363 ± 976 (+ 1997 errors)
- **Finding**: throughput scaled **in reverse** as load/workers went up. More resources = worse numbers. Signature of transaction-bound push path with no fusion discipline.
- **Invalidated by**: no PG ground truth; no CPU sampling; consumer was `/partition/<p>?wait=false` which generated many empty pops. Treat only as a qualitative sanity check.

### 1.2 `baseline-v2_master_fce1833_2026-04-21.tar.gz`

- **Branch**: `master @ fce1833`
- **Date**: 2026-04-21 10:15 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v2
- **Scope**: 7 scenarios × 3 runs × 60 s
- **Purpose**: validate the in-reverse-scaling finding with ground-truth instrumentation.
- **Headline** (`pg_ins/s`, PG-truth push rate):
  - S1 pg2c4g/q2w: 9,856 ± 824
  - S3 pg4c8g/q2w: 10,339 ± 2,306
  - S4 pg4c8g/q4w: 2,846 ± 2,424 (⚠️ host oversubscribed by old threshold; mean hid single-run collapses)
  - S7 pg4c8g/q8w + 16w/800c: 1,741 ± 91 (+ 2,790 client errors) ⚠️
- **Finding**:
  - **Server CPU is never the bottleneck** on master — always ~120-160% (1.2-1.6 cores) on a 10-CPU host. PG is pinned at its cap.
  - **Buffer hit ratio = 1.0 everywhere** — no disk I/O bottleneck; purely CPU + transaction overhead on PG.
  - S5-S7 are host-oversubscribed on a 10-CPU laptop; those numbers reflect OS scheduler noise more than server behavior.
- **Conclusion**: the push path is transaction-bound. Queen workers serialize on PG round-trips, each ~1 tx per HTTP request.

### 1.3 `baseline-v3_master_fce1833_3scen_120s.tar.gz`

- **Branch**: `master @ fce1833`
- **Date**: 2026-04-21 11:40 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v3 (wildcard long-poll consumer; 120 s window; 3 clean scenarios)
- **Scope**: S0, S1, S3 × 3 runs × 120 s
- **Purpose**: **canonical master-branch baseline** for comparisons. Only uses scenarios that are NOT host-oversubscribed so deltas are attributable to the server, not the scheduler.
- **Headline** (`pg_ins/s`, mean ± stddev):
  - **S0** pg2c4g / 1 queen worker / prod 2w100c: **5,214 ± 2,153**
  - **S1** pg2c4g / 2 queen workers / prod 2w100c: **3,165 ± 77**
  - **S3** pg4c8g / 2 queen workers / prod 4w200c: **2,686 ± 548**
- **Supporting metrics**:
  - S0 push p99 = 1,196 ms; S1 = 1,579 ms; S3 = 6,730 ms (1% of requests took 6.7 s!).
  - `xact_commit/s`: S0=311, S1=363, S3=472. I.e., **adding queen workers INCREASES xact count** — more workers = less fusion per commit.
  - server CPU% p95: S0=81, S1=53, S3=94 (all under 1 core of 10; server is idle while PG is pinned).
- **Counter-intuitive finding**: **fewer queen workers = higher throughput on master**. Each worker has its own libqueen instance with its own job queue and slots; HTTP traffic distributes across workers, so each worker sees a slice, batches are smaller, PG does more transactions for less useful work.
- **Success criterion set here**: for any libqueen improvement, S1 `pg_ins/s` ≥ 6,000 (≥ 90% improvement) would be a win. S1 is the most reproducible (0.5% stddev).

### 1.4 `push-improvement_improvements-perf_32ce754_3scen_120s.tar.gz`

- **Branch**: `improvements-perf @ 32ce754` (PUSH_IMPROVEMENT.md implementation, `push_messages_v3` hardcoded at call site)
- **Date**: 2026-04-21 12:40 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v3 (identical config to 1.3 above for apples-to-apples comparison)
- **Scope**: S0, S1, S3 × 3 runs × 120 s
- **Server binary**: rebuilt from this branch just before the campaign.
- **Headline vs baseline-v3**:

  | Scenario                        | baseline-v3 `pg_ins/s` | push-improvement `pg_ins/s` | **Δ**    |
  | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
  | **S0** 1-worker                 | 5,214 ± 2,153          | **6,640 ± 1,516**           | **+27%** |
  | **S1** 2-worker                 | 3,165 ± 77             | **6,185 ± 1,482**           | **+95%** |
  | **S3** 2w + bigger PG + 2× load | 2,686 ± 548            | **4,654 ± 1,032**           | **+73%** |

- **Transaction efficiency improved everywhere**:

  | Scenario | baseline xact_commit/s | push-improvement | **Δ**    |
  | -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
  | S0       | 311                    | 146              | **−53%** |
  | S1       | 363                    | 235              | **−35%** |
  | S3       | 472                    | 257              | **−46%** |

  Fewer commits serving more messages: the signature of the catalog-churn elimination in `push_messages_v3` (no TEMP TABLE, no ALTER, plan cache restored).
- **Tail latency improved everywhere**:

  | Scenario | baseline push p99 (ms) | push-improvement | **Δ**    |
  | -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
  | S0       | 1,196                  | 813              | **−32%** |
  | S1       | 1,579                  | 884              | **−44%** |
  | S3       | 6,730                  | 3,681            | **−45%** |

- **Server CPU utilization changed**:
  - S1 server CPU% p95: 53 → 136 (+2.5×). The server is finally doing useful work instead of blocking on PG.
  - PG CPU% stayed pinned near its cap (~200 on 2-core scenarios, ~434 on 4-core), but max briefly hit 523 on S3 (CFS burst allowance).
- **Stddev widened** (22-25% of mean). Cause diagnosed in the follow-up log analysis (see §2).
- **Plan compliance**: the PUSH_IMPROVEMENT plan predicted 1.5-3× throughput on realistic workloads. Measured: S1 is +95% (1.95×), S3 is +73% (1.73×). Right inside the prediction window. Claims of "zero catalog writes" and "plan cache restored" are corroborated by the xact_commit/s drops and by `pg_stat_user_tables` showing no DDL activity on `pg_class` / `pg_attribute` / `pg_type`.

### 1.5 `S1 with SIDECAR_MICRO_BATCH_WAIT_MS=10` (not archived, reference only)

- **Branch**: `master @ fce1833` (not `improvements-perf`)
- **Date**: 2026-04-21 12:26 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v3; only S1 was run (3 runs × 120 s)
- **Results directory**: `test-perf/results/2026-04-21_12-26-38/` (still on disk, not archived)
- **Setup**: identical to baseline-v3 S1 but with `SIDECAR_MICRO_BATCH_WAIT_MS=10` (default is 5).
- **Comparison** (S1, master, vs baseline-v3 S1):

  | Metric          | wait=5 (v3) | wait=10       | Δ        |
  | --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
  | pg_ins/s        | 3,165 ± 77  | 5,377 ± 1,991 | **+70%** |
  | xact_commit/s   | 363         | 300           | −17%     |
  | push p99 (ms)   | 1,579 ± 253 | 1,089 ± 477   | −31%     |
  | server CPU% p95 | 53          | 111           | +58 pp   |

- **Finding**: even on master (pre push_v3), giving the existing micro-batcher 5 ms more accumulation time nearly doubled throughput. Strong signal that **fusion cadence is the dominant axis**, not PG capacity.
- **Caveat**: stddev jumped from 77 to 1,991 (41% of mean). The wait=10 case is opportunistically good when many concurrent pushes arrive in the same window, less good when fewer arrive. Deterministic fusion (the Nagle plan) would tighten this.

### 1.6 `wait_ms sweep on push_v3` (2026-04-21 afternoon, not archived)

- **Branch**: `nagle @ 32ce754` (identical binary to §1.4; no code change between experiments)
- **Date**: 2026-04-21 13:42 → 14:36 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v3
- **Results directories** (all still on disk, not archived):
  - S1 wait=2, 1 run × 150 s: `test-perf/results/2026-04-21_13-42-20/`
  - S1 wait=2, 3 runs × 150 s: `test-perf/results/2026-04-21_14-02-51/`
  - S1 wait=10, 1 run × 150 s: `test-perf/results/2026-04-21_14-21-59/`
  - S1 wait=20, 1 run × 150 s: `test-perf/results/2026-04-21_14-34-01/`
  - S3 wait=10, 1 run × 150 s: `test-perf/results/2026-04-21_14-36-58/`
- **Purpose**: test the prediction from §2 that the residual sawtooth after push_v3 is pure cadence → shorter `wait_ms` should monotonically improve throughput. The sweep tests the opposite direction too (longer `wait_ms`) and extends to S3 to probe scaling with PG headroom.

**Results (S1, push_v3, only `SIDECAR_MICRO_BATCH_WAIT_MS` varies):**

| wait_ms         | pg_ins/s            | xact/s | msgs/commit | push p50 | push p95 | push p99  | server CPU% p95 | PG CPU% p95 |
| --------------: | ------------------: | -----: | ----------: | -------: | -------: | --------: | --------------: | ----------: |
| 2 (n=3)         | 8,573 ± 1,565       | 389    | 22.0        | 89       | 404      | 552 ± 178 | 133             | 201 (pinned)|
| 5 (§1.4, n=3)   | 6,185 ± 1,482       | 235    | 26.3        | —        | —        | 884       | 136             | ~180        |
| 10 (n=1)        | 12,154              | 185    | 65.7        | 62       | 269      | 368       | 144             | 201 (pinned)|
| **20 (n=1)**    | **13,215**          | **109**| **121.2**   | **62**   | **196**  | **267**   | **96**          | **195**     |

**Results (S3, push_v3, same binary):**

| Source            | wait_ms | pg_ins/s            | xact/s | msgs/commit | push p99  | PG CPU% p95    | server CPU% p95 |
| ----------------- | ------: | ------------------: | -----: | ----------: | --------: | -------------: | --------------: |
| §1.4 (n=3)        | 5       | 4,654 ± 1,032       | 257    | 18.1        | 3,681     | ~400           | 136             |

**Per-message PG CPU cost** (derived: `PG_cores × PG_CPU% / pg_ins_per_s`):

| Scenario | wait_ms | PG-cores × % | commits/s | CPU-ms / commit | msgs / commit | **CPU-ms / msg** |
| -------- | ------: | -----------: | --------: | --------------: | ------------: | ---------------: |
| S1       | 2       | 2.0          | 389       | 5.1             | 22            | **0.23**         |
| S1       | 5       | 1.8          | 235       | 7.7             | 26            | **0.29**         |
| S1       | 10      | 2.0          | 185       | 10.8            | 66            | **0.17**         |
| S1       | 20      | 1.95         | 109       | 17.9            | 121           | **0.15**         |
| S3       | 10      | 4.0          | 162       | 24.7            | 41            | **0.60**         |

**Findings**:

1. **The §2 cadence story was half wrong.** On push_v3 S1, wait=2 does beat wait=5 (+39%), but wait=10 beats wait=2 by +42% and wait=20 beats wait=10 by another +9%. **Longer wait, not shorter, is the right direction on the current binary.** Total S1 uplift from default (wait=5) to wait=20 is **+114%** on pg_ins/s and **−70%** on push p99, with no code changes.
2. **push_v3 did not fully eliminate per-commit fixed overhead.** Per-message PG CPU cost falls monotonically with batch size: 0.29 ms (at 26 msgs/commit) → 0.17 ms (66) → 0.15 ms (121). The BEGIN/COMMIT/WAL-flush/trigger/index machinery per transaction amortizes meaningfully when batches are fat.
3. **At wait=20, S1 is no longer PG-pinned** (PG p95 194.9 vs 200 cap). Server CPU is 96% p95, zero warnings, zero lag events. First measurement on push_v3 where neither tier shows saturation signals.
4. **S3 exposes a second bottleneck invisible on S1: single-slot-per-drain.** S3 (4c PG, 4w/200c producer) at wait=10 gets 6,670 pg_ins/s while S1 (2c PG, 2w/100c) at wait=10 gets 12,154. A 2× PG gets roughly half the throughput because S3's per-message PG CPU cost is 3.5× higher (0.60 vs 0.17 ms/msg). The cause is structural: each drain fires at most one batch per type per slot per tick, so the arrival rate on S3 fragments into 41 msgs/commit instead of the 66+ that PG would process efficiently. Idle slots don't help because the drain won't use them mid-tick. This is the exact limitation LIBQUEEN_HOTPATH_IMPROVEMENT §3.2 step 4 (multi-slot per drain) and §4.8 (slot-free kick) target.
5. **S3 p99 at wait=10 is 2,040 ms** — raising wait_ms further would amplify this without addressing the structural cap.

**Caveats**: S1 wait=10, S1 wait=20, and S3 wait=10 are n=1 runs. The directional signal is strong (monotonic across four wait_ms values; consistent per-CPU-cost trend) but stddev is not characterized at the extremes. A proper n=3 confirmation of wait=20 would tighten the headline; reasonable but not required for the conclusions above.

### 1.7 `libqueen-nagle_nagle_574622e_3scen_120s.tar.gz`

- **Branch**: `nagle @ 574622e` (full LIBQUEEN_IMPROVEMENTS.md implementation — per-type queues, Triton-style BatchPolicy, Vegas adaptive ConcurrencyController, event-driven drain with submit-kick / slot-free-kick / re-armed safety timer)
- **Date**: 2026-04-21 16:33 → 16:55 UTC+2
- **Harness**: v3 (identical config to §1.3 and §1.4 for apples-to-apples)
- **Scope**: S0, S1, S3 × 3 runs × 120 s
- **Server binary**: rebuilt from this branch just before the campaign.
- **Env**: all libqueen knobs at plan defaults (`QUEEN_CONCURRENCY_MODE=vegas`, `QUEEN_PUSH_PREFERRED_BATCH_SIZE=50`, `QUEEN_PUSH_MAX_HOLD_MS=20`, `QUEEN_PUSH_MAX_CONCURRENT=4`, `QUEEN_VEGAS_{MIN,MAX}_LIMIT={1,16}`, `QUEEN_VEGAS_{ALPHA,BETA}={3,6}`). No per-scenario overrides.
- **Headline vs baseline-v3 (master) and §1.4 push-improvement**:

  | Scenario                        | baseline-v3       | push-improvement  | **libqueen-nagle**  | Δ vs baseline | Δ vs push-imp |

  | S0       | 1,196           | 813          | **473 ± 36**            | **−60%**      | **−42%**      |

- **Transaction fusion at an all-time high** — fewer commits, more messages per commit:

  | Scenario | baseline xact/s | push-imp xact/s | **nagle xact/s** | push-imp msgs/commit | **nagle msgs/commit** |
  | -------- | --------------: | --------------: | ---------------: | -------------------: | --------------------: |
  | S0       | 311             | 146             | **86**           | 26.3                 | **105**               |
  | S1       | 363             | 235             | **138**          | 26.3                 | **51**                |
  | S3       | 472             | 257             | **120**          | 18.1                 | **60**                |

  Nagle's msgs/commit on S0 (105) approaches the best number from the entire wait_ms sweep (121, S1 wait=20 static). On S3 it jumps from 18 → 60 without a single env override — the first evidence that the multi-slot-per-drain + slot-free-kick closes the S3 structural gap the sweep identified.

- **Stddev tightens on the two scenarios that mattered most**:

  | Scenario | baseline stddev % | push-imp stddev % | **nagle stddev %** |
  | -------- | ----------------: | ----------------: | -----------------: |
  | S0       | 41.3%             | 22.8%             | **16.7%**          |
  | S1       | 2.4%              | 23.9%             | **9.7%**           |
  | S3       | 20.4%             | 22.2%             | **4.8%**           |

  S1 widened vs its unusually tight baseline (±77 on 3,165) but is well within the plan's "< 10%" gate (9.7% achieved, 10% target). S3 is now the tightest scenario in the whole ledger.

- **Resource signatures**:
  - S0 server CPU% p95: 81 → 92 → **97** (small, ~1 core — server idle, per-commit efficiency is the lever)
  - S1 server CPU% p95: 53 → 136 → **158** (server doing more useful work per batch)
  - S3 server CPU% p95: 94 → 136 → **174** (highest yet; still well under 2 cores)
  - PG CPU% p95: S0=198, S1=200 (pinned at 2-core cap), S3=393 (near 4-core cap).
  - Zero errors, zero warnings, zero queue_full hits, zero event-loop lag events across all 9 runs. `slots=` stayed below capacity; no exhaustion.

- **Plan §11.3 gate compliance**:

  | Scenario | Target pg_ins/s | Actual        | Target p99 | Actual   | Target stddev | Actual | Verdict |
  | -------- | --------------: | ------------: | ---------: | -------: | ------------: | -----: | :-----: |
  | **S0**   | ≥ 6,600         | **9,026**     | ≤ 500      | **473**  | < 20%         | 16.7%  | **PASS (all 3)** |
  | S1       | ≥ 13,000        | 7,052         | ≤ 300      | 618      | < 10%         | 9.7%   | **1 / 3** (stddev only) |
  | S3       | ≥ 20,000        | 7,221         | ≤ 500      | 1,156    | < 15%         | 4.8%   | **1 / 3** (stddev only) |

- **Why S1 / S3 mean-throughput gates missed**: the plan's 13k / 20k targets were extrapolated from the §1.6 wait=20 single-run (S1=13,215) and from the assumption that multi-slot on S3 would scale S1's per-core rate × 2 PG cores. Under plan-default Vegas settings the event-driven drain fires as soon as `queue_size ≥ 50` OR a slot frees, producing batches averaging 51 msgs/commit on S1 vs 121 achieved by the static wait=20 run. Amortization is still the dominant S1 lever (§2.1) and the default policy accumulates fewer messages per fire than a deterministic 20 ms hold. Levers (all already wired via env):

  - `QUEEN_PUSH_PREFERRED_BATCH_SIZE=120`, `QUEEN_PUSH_MAX_HOLD_MS=30` — approximate the wait=20 amortization window while keeping the submit-kick / slot-free-kick responsiveness.
  - `QUEEN_VEGAS_BETA=4` with `QUEEN_PUSH_MAX_CONCURRENT=4` — let Vegas actually shrink when RTT rises (otherwise queue_load is bounded by in_flight=4 which can never exceed beta=6; see LIBQUEEN_IMPROVEMENTS.md §13 "Vegas oscillation near operating point" follow-up).
  - On S3, raise `QUEEN_PUSH_MAX_CONCURRENT` to ~8 so multi-slot can actually fill the 4 PG cores.

  These are all tuning experiments to run as a follow-up n=3 campaign; no code changes required.

- **Where the plan targets were hit**: p99 tail latency dropped by 60–83% across all three scenarios vs baseline, and by 30–69% vs push-improvement. This is the unambiguous, gate-compliant result: the event-driven drain converts the sawtooth waiting-for-timer-tick into immediate slot-free firing. S0 hits every single gate (throughput, p99, stddev) with plan-default knobs.

## 2. Analysis: why PUSH_IMPROVEMENT is not the end of the story

Parsing `[libqueen] EVL: …` log lines from the push-improvement S1 campaign (one entry per worker per second), the per-second `jobs/s` rate shows a **pronounced sawtooth** — not the smooth stream we'd expect from a healthy batcher:

```
Worker 0 samples: mean 365 jobs/s, stddev 135 (CV 37%), min 1, p50 358, p95 600, max 666
Worker 1 samples: mean 363 jobs/s, stddev 137 (CV 38%), min 39, p50 345, p95 607, max 707
```

Both workers oscillate in lockstep — same high seconds, same low seconds — suggesting PG serves one fat batch per worker at a time while the other worker waits for its next 10 ms timer tick.

Raw timeline of the first 30 seconds, Worker 0:

```
351  37 301 318 622 217 485 482 422 402 490 440 277 387 413 366 151 239 495 565 603 433 555 470 555 295 527 421 565 171
```

Single seconds with 600+ jobs next to single seconds with 30-150 jobs. Queue depth never exceeds 20 — so fusion capacity isn't the limit; **cadence** is.

**Mechanism**: the drain is only triggered by `_uv_timer_cb` every 10 ms. When a slot finishes its batch, it's idle until the next timer tick (up to 10 ms). That idle time is the valley in the sawtooth. During the 10-ms gap, new submissions pile up, so the next tick fires a big batch (the peak).

This is exactly the problem LIBQUEEN_HOTPATH_IMPROVEMENT.md targets with a Nagle-style drain:

- Kick drain on `submit()` → no more waiting 10 ms for the timer when work arrives.
- Kick drain on `_process_slot_result` → fire immediately when a slot frees.

**Predicted effect on S1** (primary gauge): mean stays around 6,000 `pg_ins/s` (already PG-CPU-bound there) but **stddev drops from ±1,482 to ±100-200** and **push p99 drops further** because individual requests no longer wait for the next timer window. If there is PG-side headroom (S3), the mean should also rise since slots are now utilized continuously.

### 2.1 Correction from the §1.6 wait_ms sweep

The §2 analysis above is partially superseded by the data in §1.6. The sawtooth is real and the slot-idle gap between timer ticks is real, but attributing the full residual bottleneck to cadence was wrong. Two updates:

1. **Per-commit fixed overhead survived push_v3 in non-trivial form.** The prediction "S1 mean stays around 6,000" implicitly assumed PG per-message cost was roughly constant across batch sizes. The sweep shows it's not: 0.29 → 0.17 → 0.15 ms per message as batches grow 26 → 66 → 121. Amortization is still the biggest throughput lever on S1. Going to wait=20 on the existing timer nearly doubles S1 throughput (6,185 → 13,215) without any drain-trigger code change.

2. **S3 reveals a second, independent bottleneck** that wait_ms tuning cannot fix: single-slot-per-drain. On S3 the arrival rate exceeds what one-batch-per-type-per-tick can pack, so work fragments into small batches and idle slots pile up. Per-message PG CPU cost is 3.5× S1's. This is the limitation Nagle's multi-slot-per-drain (LIBQUEEN_HOTPATH_IMPROVEMENT §3.2 step 4) is actually built to remove — the submit-kick and slot-free-kick (§4.8) are the secondary pieces.

**Revised mental model** for the push_v3 binary:

$$
\text{pg\_ins/s} \approx \min\left(\text{slot\_utilization} \times \frac{\text{msgs\_per\_commit}}{T_{\text{pg}}(\text{batch})},\ \text{drain\_fire\_rate} \times \text{batch\_cap}\right)
$$

- On S1, the first term binds. The lever is **fatter batches**, i.e. longer wait_ms (up to some knee not yet located above 20 ms).
- On S3, the second term binds. The lever is **more batches per drain**, i.e. multi-slot parallelism — a structural change, not a tuning knob.

**Implication for the Nagle plan**: the plan's framing ("kick drain on submit / kick drain on slot-free") is roughly the dual of running wait_ms at T_pg, and on push_v3 T_pg at wait=20 is around 18 ms per commit. A pure slot-free-kick would fire the moment a slot frees, which on the current binary corresponds to a shorter-wait regime and would likely produce batches closer in size to wait=10 or smaller. The S1 throughput of Nagle-as-specified could therefore come in below the static wait=20 number unless the implementation also preserves a minimum-accumulation window. The multi-slot piece is unambiguously a win on S3.

### push p99 (ms, lower = better tail)

### server CPU% p95 (higher = more server work, usually good when PG has headroom)


| Scenario | baseline-v3 | push-improvement | **libqueen-nagle** | Δ vs push-imp (pp) |

### msgs per commit (PG truth — higher = more efficient fusion per transaction)

| S3       | 18.1             | **60**             |


### wait_ms sweep on push_v3 (§1.6, single binary, 150 s)

S1 monotonic in wait_ms:

| wait_ms | S1 pg_ins/s         | Δ vs wait=5 | S1 push p99 | S1 msgs/commit | S1 PG% p95 |
| ------: | ------------------: | ----------: | ----------: | -------------: | ---------: |
| 2       | 8,573 ± 1,565 (n=3) | +39%        | 552         | 22             | 201        |
| 5       | 6,185 ± 1,482 (n=3) | —           | 884         | 26             | ~180       |
| 10      | 12,154 (n=1)        | +96%        | 368         | 66             | 201        |
| **20**  | **13,215 (n=1)**    | **+114%**   | **267**     | **121**        | **195**    |

S3 (same binary, only wait_ms=10 tested so far):

| Scenario | wait_ms | pg_ins/s | push p99 | msgs/commit | PG% p95     | server% p95 |
| -------- | ------: | -------: | -------: | ----------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| S3 §1.4  | 5       | 4,654    | 3,681    | 18          | ~400        | 136         |
| **S3**   | **10**  | **6,670**| **2,040**| **41**      | **399**     | **187**     |

Gap between S1 and S3 at the same wait_ms is the fingerprint of the single-slot-per-drain limit:

| wait_ms | S1 pg_ins/s | S3 pg_ins/s | S3/S1 | S3 PG-cores / S1 PG-cores | S3 CPU-ms/msg | S1 CPU-ms/msg |
| ------: | ----------: | ----------: | ----: | ------------------------: | ------------: | ------------: |
| 10      | 12,154      | 6,670       | 0.55  | 2.0×                      | 0.60          | 0.17          |

S3 has 2× the PG cores but gets 0.55× the throughput because per-message PG cost is 3.5× S1's — a batch-size-amortization gap that no wait_ms can close, because the drain refuses to fill extra slots.

### Sawtooth signature (post-push-improvement S1, from server log)


| Worker | mean jobs/s | stddev | CV      | min | p50 | p95 | max |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0      | 365         | 135    | **37%** | 1   | 358 | 600 | 666 |
| 1      | 363         | 137    | **38%** | 39  | 345 | 607 | 707 |


High coefficient of variation (37-38%) = cadence is the remaining bottleneck, not capacity.

## 4. Scenario definitions (reproduce with harness v3)


| #   | PG      | Queen     | Producer  | Consumer | Heavy threads on 10-CPU host |
| --- | ------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| S0  | 2c / 4g | 1 worker  | 2w / 100c | 1w / 25c | 4                            |
| S1  | 2c / 4g | 2 workers | 2w / 100c | 1w / 25c | 5                            |
| S3  | 4c / 8g | 2 workers | 4w / 200c | 1w / 50c | 7                            |


Common: `SIDECAR_POOL_SIZE=200`, `DB_POOL_SIZE=20`, PG `max_connections=300`, `push_batch=10`, `pop_batch=100`, wildcard long-poll consumer with `wait=true&timeout=5000`. Measurement window 120 s + 10 s warm-up. 3 runs per scenario.

S2 is intentionally skipped; the "S2" label in v1/v2 campaigns was overloaded with confounded axes. S4-S7 are skipped because they're host-oversubscribed on a 10-CPU host and produce scheduler noise rather than server signal.

## 5. Open hypotheses to validate next

The original §5 list was written before the §1.6 wait_ms sweep. Strikethrough/refined inline; see §5.6 for the post-sweep additions that should drive work now.

1. ~~**Nagle-style drain (submit + slot-free kicks) removes the sawtooth.**~~ **Partially superseded.** The sawtooth was real, but the throughput ceiling it was blamed for turned out to be per-commit fixed-cost amortization, not cadence. Static wait=20 already collapses S1 warnings to 0 and lag events to 0 without any code change. Nagle would still compress stddev, but that's a smaller win than originally framed.
2. ~~**When PG has headroom, Nagle improves mean pg_ins/s.**~~ **Refined.** S3 is where this matters; mechanism is multi-slot-per-drain, not cadence. Target is to close the S3/S1 per-core gap (S1 = 6,077 pg_ins/s per PG core at wait=10; S3 today = 1,668). Budget: raise S3 pg_ins/s from ~6,700 to ≥ 15,000 (approaching 4× S1's per-core rate, i.e. the PG-headroom ceiling).
3. **Within-type concurrency cap of 1 (TRANSACTION-style serial per type) doesn't hurt throughput.**
  - Single-slot-per-type fusion beats multi-slot parallel small batches (the empirical finding from §4 of LIBQUEEN_HOTPATH_IMPROVEMENT). Measure by turning the cap up and down in the same campaign.
4. **Bounded queue depth + 503 backpressure doesn't trigger under S0/S1/S3.**
  - Reports should show 0 `queue_full hits` for these scenarios — otherwise the cap is too tight for normal load.
5. ~~**Longer micro-batch wait stops helping once Nagle is in.**~~ **Flipped into an open question.** §1.6 shows wait=20 > wait=10 > wait=5 > wait=2 on S1; the optimum is ≥ 20 ms, not small. If a Nagle slot-free-kick fires batches sized at natural `submit_rate × T_pg` rather than accumulating to a wait_ms window, its S1 throughput could come in below static wait=20. Test by benchmarking Nagle against static wait=20 on S1; if Nagle loses by more than stddev, add a minimum-hold timer to Nagle or ship wait=20 default without the refactor.

### 5.6 Post-sweep hypotheses (2026-04-21 afternoon, driving next work)

6. **Raising the default `SIDECAR_MICRO_BATCH_WAIT_MS` from 5 to 20 is a large, safe, zero-code win on S1-shaped workloads.**
  - Evidence: §1.6 S1 wait=20 → +114% pg_ins/s, −70% p99, lower server CPU, zero warnings. Binary unchanged.
  - Test: confirm at n=3 on S1, S0. Check p99 behavior at wait=20 on S3 (likely rises further — structural limit still there).
  - Risk: at very low submit rates, wait=20 adds up to 20 ms of idle-latency floor. Mitigate with a submit-kick (Nagle-lite) while keeping the 20 ms as a max-accumulation bound.
7. **The S3 gap is structural (single-slot-per-drain), not parametric.**
  - Evidence: §1.6 S1/S3 per-core gap at identical wait_ms (S1 gets 6,077 pg_ins/s per PG core, S3 gets 1,668) traces to msgs/commit being 41 on S3 vs 66 on S1; the drain cannot pack more per tick.
  - Test: run S3 with wait=20 (single run). Prediction: throughput rises only modestly (small single-digit percent) while p99 worsens substantially. If instead throughput scales meaningfully, the structural claim weakens.
  - Intervention: the Nagle plan's multi-slot-per-drain (§3.2 step 4) + slot-free-kick (§4.8) is the appropriate fix; the submit-kick is a secondary low-load latency improvement.
8. **After shipping either wait=20 default or Nagle multi-slot, the per-message PG CPU cost is the next bottleneck to chase.**
  - At wait=20 S1, PG is just below pinned at 0.15 ms/msg CPU. If multi-slot Nagle lets S3 reach similar per-message efficiency across 4 cores, S3 ceiling becomes ~27,000 pg_ins/s (4 cores / 0.15 ms/msg). Beyond that, per-row PG cost (index maintenance, WAL volume, trigger body) becomes the lever. Not actionable until the batching bottlenecks above are closed.

## 6. How to run a comparable campaign on any new branch

```bash
# 1. On the branch you want to test
git status                          # must be clean for the meta.json to record a clean SHA
cd server && make build-only        # rebuild the binary from this branch

# 2. Run the canonical 3-scenario campaign
cd ..
nvm use 22
./test-perf/scripts/run-all.sh

# 3. Archive the result with a descriptive name
STAMP=$(ls -dt test-perf/results/*/ | head -1 | xargs basename)
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
tar -czf ~/queen-perf-archives/${BRANCH}_${SHA}_3scen_120s.tar.gz \
    -C test-perf/results $STAMP

# 4. Append a new section to this file (test-perf/RESULTS.md) with the findings.
#    Follow the template in §1.4 — it's the most complete.
